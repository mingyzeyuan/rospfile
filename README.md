some additional files to be used accompanying the project at https://github.com/Casual-Ragnarok/ro-single-server

This description is updated on 2 July 2023. It may not be relevant or working anymore if the original project is updated at a later date.
The project here https://github.com/Casual-Ragnarok/ro-single-server is a specific version of single player server for the classic mmorpg RO.
The four files here are to be used in accompany with this project only, and are not expected to work with any other projects, even similar ones.
RO private server setup has many components and the files used here are one-click auto setup with many pre-configured preferences, which means the files are not expected to be compatible widely to other private server setups.
The three bat files are to be placed in the same folder where the emulator is located. The file path needs to be full English without any space.
The three files are 
1.启动架设环境
2.启动99maxeathena三转（复兴后）
3.关闭架设环境
You will not need the three bat files of similar names downloaded from the repository.
The fourth file is my.inf, which is the default database file to be used upon initiation of the server. 
The file is to be placed under the path of emulator/usr/local/mysql
